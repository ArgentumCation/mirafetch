A Rust reimplementation of Hyfetch wih a focus on speed

## Installation

## Notes
- Currently this has only been tested on Ubuntu 23.10, and Windows 11, I could definitely use help testing on other platforms
- There's currently no support for macOS, if you have a Mac and want to port this, feel free to make a PR

## Tested on:
- Windows 11
- Ubuntu 23.10
- Pop! OS 20.04
